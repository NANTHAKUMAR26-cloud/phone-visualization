The PhonePe Pulse project is a comprehensive data science mini-project that extracts, processes, and visualizes transaction data from the PhonePe Pulse platform. The project involves gathering large volumes of digital payment transaction data from the PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository, tabulating and cleaning the dataset, and storing it efficiently for further analysis. Using Python, Streamlit, and SQL databases, the project delivers interactive dashboards that offer deep insights into payment trends, transaction patterns, and customer behavior across different states and time periods in India. This project demonstrates the power of modern data visualization and analytics, making complex fintech data both accessible and actionable for business intelligence and decision-making.
